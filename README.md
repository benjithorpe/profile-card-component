## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Went over CSS `position` & `z-index` properties again and I have learnt a lot more about using them.

```css
.top-circle img{
  position: absolute;
  top: -65em;
  left: -69em;
}

.bottom-circle img{
  position: absolute;
  right: -67em;
  bottom: -62.5em;
}
```
